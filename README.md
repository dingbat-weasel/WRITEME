## Description

Welcome to WRITEME, a dynamic CLI README generator running on node and the inquirer module. As the user answers CLI prompts, their answers are stored and appended to a README file. This file can then be copied into the user's repo. It is recommended to edit the README afterward as it may still include any additional fields the user left blank.

## Features

<li>Dynamically generate a README file</li>

## Usage

The CLI will display prompts in the terminal window. Type your reply to these prompts and press enter. Once you are done they will be added to the README.md file in the output directory.
