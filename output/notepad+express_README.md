## Description

Note taker is a web app created using Node and Express.js. It allows users to write notes and save them to a database. This was a huge step for me as it is my first project utilizing a server and configuring routes. Although the database is just a json file it is still exciting to begin to work more with the backend of a webapp. Enjoy!
